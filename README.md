# Natural Language Processing

This WIP repository is a collection of notebooks created while learning NLP in Python. All reviewed books and additional resources will be linked as this progresses and a Zotero Group has been started: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4907365/nlp_bio. Note, most of the resources in the bibliography will skew clinical/bioinformatics, but I will try to include general resources as well. 

WIP: The "Getting_Started_with_NLP" .ipynb is me working through *Getting Started with Natural Language Processing* by Ekaterina Kochmar (2022). You can access the eBook [here](https://livebook.manning.com/book/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing/chapter-1/v-10/) and Kochmar's code for the book is [here](https://github.com/ekochmar/Getting-Started-with-NLP).
