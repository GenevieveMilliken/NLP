# Natural Language Processing

This WIP repository is a collection of notes/notebooks created while learning NLP in Python. All reviewed books and additional resources will be linked as learning progresses and a Zotero Group has been started: https://www.zotero.org/groups/4907365/nlp_bio. Note, most of the resources in this bibliography will skew clinical/bioinformatics, but I will try to include general resources as well.
